# SmartOrganizer

**SmartOrganizer** is a project aimed at ya'll lazy bones (myself included) or what I like to call it **_highly efficient beings_** that don't have the time to spare on something as petty and minuscule as organizing our _desktops_ something some of us call **"home"**. But fret no further SmartOrganizer is here to the rescue and not only is it extremely lightweight coming in at **_2.8 - 3.2MB_** disk space and on average consumes less than **_50MB_** of ram with tonnes of listeners all made possible by **_@tauri-apps_**, A proper benchmarking may need to be done.
